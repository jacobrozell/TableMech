# App Shell Spec — TableMech

Companion: [IOS26PlatformSpec](IOS26PlatformSpec.md) · [MatchSessionSpec](features/MatchSessionSpec.md).

## Root information architecture

Four tabs (phone + iPad via `.sidebarAdaptable`):

| Tab | SF Symbol | Entry ID | Notes |
|-----|-----------|----------|-------|
| Play | `flag.checkered` | `play.home` | AS home + Classic Coming soon |
| Force | `shield.lefthalf.filled` | `force.as.list` | Ridge Line roster (or the match in progress) |
| Rules | `book` | `rules.home` | AS topics |
| Settings | `gearshape` | `settings.home` | Always |

### Tab behavior (iOS 26)

- `.tabBarMinimizeBehavior(.onScrollDown)` on the root `TabView`
- `.tabViewStyle(.sidebarAdaptable)`
- No UIKit tab appearance proxies
- No search tab in 1.0  

## Play routing

```
play.home
  ├─ Resume (if active MatchSession) → fullScreenCover as.battle
  ├─ Play Ridge Line → fullScreenCover as.battle
  ├─ How to play → push (as.howToPlay)
  ├─ New here? → push (as.gettingStarted)
  └─ Classic BattleTech → sheet (classic.modeHome)
```

How to play and Getting Started are `navigationDestination` pushes from Play, so the tab bar stays. Settings repeats both as `NavigationLink` pushes. Classic is `ClassicComingSoonSheet` at a medium detent, identifier `classic.modeHome`, with `classic.comingSoon.playAS` starting Ridge Line after the sheet closes. The Play row is `play.classicComingSoon`.

Free Battle hidden in Release (1.1). There is no separate first-launch intro screen. Until a game starts or resumes, Play can subtitle the mission “New here? Start with the 2-minute checklist” (`hasSeenIntro`). Starting or resuming sets the flag.

Appearance follows the system. Settings → Theme overrides it (`AppPreferences.theme`, applied in `TableMechApp`).

## Battle immersion

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Presentation | `fullScreenCover` from Play |
| Phase dock | Glass inside cover |
| Dismiss to Play | **Leave** keeps the active session. No discard prompt |
| Abandon | **Discard this game** in More, with a confirm |

## Sheet stack rules

| Sheet | Detent | Stacking |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `as.unitFocus` | medium, large | From a unit card. Shoot or Roll critical runs after this sheet dismisses |
| `as.sator` | large | From **Solve a shot** or from Unit Focus. Apply dismisses it |
| `as.critRoll` | medium, large | After the solver is gone. The battle step shows `CriticalPendingStep`; the dock **Roll critical** presents this sheet. Closing it leaves the crit owed |
| `as.battle.log` | medium, large | Toolbar **What just happened** |
| Classic coming soon | medium | From Play. Identifier `classic.modeHome` |

Apply dismisses the solver first. The battle step then shows the critical, and the dock opens the crit sheet. Initiative and movement are steps on the battle screen.

## Deep links

No custom URL scheme is registered. Play, Force, Rules, and Settings are the four tabs.

## Onboarding vs Getting Started

| Flow | When | Persist |
|------|------|---------|
| Play subtitle nudge | `!hasSeenIntro` and the checklist is unfinished | Starting or resuming a game sets `hasSeenIntro` |
| Getting Started checklist | Push from Play (“New here?”) or Settings (“New here checklist”) | `AppPreferences.gettingStartedChecks` |

The checklist is optional. It never blocks Play Ridge Line.
